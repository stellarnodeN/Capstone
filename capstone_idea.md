## Overview

RecruSearch is a decentralized, privacy-first protocol for research participation built on Solana. It enables pseudonymous, fraud-resistant data collection through encrypted off-chain storage and on-chain consent, for sensitive studies in academia and DeSci.

## Core Value Proposition

RecruSearch is a privacy-first, fraud-resistant research participation protocol built on Solana, designed to address issues in traditional data collection of sensitive, high-integrity research data. It enables academic and DeSci researchers to post studies with customizable eligibility logic, while allowing participants to engage pseudonymously using wallet-based identities. Unlike traditional platforms, RecruSearch prioritizes participant privacy from the outset by implementing client-side encryption, off-chain secure storage, and on-chain consent validation through smart contracts.

In its MVP stage, RecruSearch focuses on offering a lean yet powerful feature set: verifiable consent tokens (NFTs), pseudonymous participation, encrypted data capture, and token-based incentives (SPL tokens or NFTs) to increase engagement and reward honest contributions. Researchers benefit from high-integrity, cryptographically verifiable datasets while avoiding the regulatory and ethical risks of collecting personal identifiers. RecruSearch is especially positioned to support studies involving vulnerable populations or stigmatized topics—such as mental health, PTSD, or trauma research—where participant anonymity is paramount.

The protocol further provides a foundation for open science by ensuring transparent provenance of research participation, laying the groundwork for long-term reproducibility and auditability of scientific claims. Over time, advanced features like zero-knowledge proofs, DAO governance for open science reviews, and institutional integrations can be layered on without compromising the platform's core privacy ethos. By starting lean and scaling responsibly, RecruSearch bridges the trust gap between researchers and participants in an increasingly data-skeptical world.

## Competitor Landscape

| Competitor                  | Category                        | Weakness vs. RecruSearch                                      |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Qualtrics / REDCap         | Academic survey platforms        | Centralized, stores PII, lacks privacy-preserving design      |
| Prolific / MTurk           | Participant recruitment engines  | No cryptographic verification, not pseudonymous               |
| Ocean Protocol / ECKOchain | Web3 data infra                  | Not tailored to research workflows or participant incentives   |
| Quantinar / OpenTrials     | Reproducibility tools            | Don’t handle participation, consent, or privacy               |
| Medable / TrialChain       | Clinical research infra          | Closed source, enterprise-focused, not pseudonymous           |
| Streamr / Swash            | Data monetization platforms      | Tokenized data sharing, but not designed for research protocols|
| Bloom / SpruceID / Ceramic | Decentralized identity systems   | Provide DIDs and proofs, but no research-layer integration    |

While each of these competitors offers value within their specific verticals, none bring together RecruSearch's unique mix of privacy-preserving architecture, participant incentives, decentralized governance potential, and research workflow compatibility. By integrating cryptographic consent, pseudonymity, and token-based engagement into a cohesive protocol, RecruSearch fills a distinct gap at the intersection of ethical research and Web3 infrastructure. This makes it especially attractive to early adopters who value both scientific rigor and user data sovereignty.

## Founder-Market Fit

The founder of RecruSearch is uniquely positioned at the intersection of scientific research and blockchain development. With advanced degrees in Early Childhood Research and Clinical Psychology, they bring lived experience of the difficulties surrounding participant recruitment, data sensitivity, and ethical consent in traditional research workflows. Their background enables them to empathize with and anticipate the needs of both researchers and participants—particularly those working in high-risk or stigmatized domains.

On the technical side, the founder has deep expertise in blockchain development on Solana, including hands-on knowledge of Rust, Anchor, and TypeScript. This technical grounding, combined with participation in leading Web3 R&D cohorts, ensures they can architect secure, scalable systems that respond directly to real-world research challenges. Their active presence in the Solana developer ecosystem—collaborating with researchers, developers, and open science advocates—strengthens their ability to build and iterate quickly based on community input.

This multidisciplinary alignment—practical research knowledge, technical expertise, and a strong network—creates a compelling founder-market fit. However, one potential weakness is the founder’s limited commercial experience in scaling B2B or institutional SaaS platforms, which could be a factor in adoption by universities or medical research organizations. This gap can be mitigated by partnering with domain-specific advisors and early design partners to validate product-market fit and build institutional trust.

Overall, the founder’s combination of personal experience, technical skill, and community insight makes them especially credible to early adopters within the academic, clinical, and Web3-native research communities.
