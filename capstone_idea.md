## Core Value Proposition

RecruSearch is a privacy-first, fraud-resistant research participation protocol built on Solana, designed to address issues in traditional data collection of sensitive, high-integrity research data. It enables academic and DeSci researchers to post studies with customizable eligibility logic, while allowing participants to engage pseudonymously using wallet-based identities. Unlike traditional platforms, RecruSearch prioritizes participant privacy from the outset by implementing client-side encryption, off-chain secure storage, and on-chain consent validation through smart contracts.

In its MVP stage, RecruSearch focuses on offering a lean yet powerful feature set: verifiable consent tokens (NFTs), pseudonymous participation, encrypted data capture, and token-based incentives (SPL tokens or NFTs) to increase engagement and reward honest contributions. Researchers benefit from high-integrity, cryptographically verifiable datasets while avoiding the regulatory and ethical risks of collecting personal identifiers. RecruSearch is especially positioned to support studies involving vulnerable populations or stigmatized topics—such as mental health, PTSD, or trauma research—where participant anonymity is paramount.

The protocol further provides a foundation for open science by ensuring transparent provenance of research participation, laying the groundwork for long-term reproducibility and auditability of scientific claims. Over time, advanced features like zero-knowledge proofs, DAO governance for open science reviews, and institutional integrations can be layered on without compromising the platform's core privacy ethos. By starting lean and scaling responsibly, RecruSearch bridges the trust gap between researchers and participants in an increasingly data-skeptical world.

## Dual NFT Consent and Completion Model

To enhance both ethical compliance and participant engagement, RecruSearch implements a dual NFT/token model for research participation:

### 1. Consent NFT (Minted at Study Entry)
- **Purpose:** Serves as cryptographic proof that a participant has reviewed and agreed to the study’s consent form.
- **When Minted:** At the moment the participant consents and joins the study (before any data is submitted).
- **Benefits:**
  - Provides verifiable, on-chain evidence of informed consent.
  - Acts as a gatekeeper, ensuring only eligible and consenting participants can access the study.
  - Supports privacy by enabling pseudonymous, wallet-based participation.

### 2. Completion NFT or Reward Token (Minted at Study Completion)
- **Purpose:** Serves as proof of participation or completion, and/or as a reward for honest data submission.
- **When Minted:** After the participant submits valid data and completes the study.
- **Benefits:**
  - Incentivizes honest and complete participation.
  - Can be used for reputation, access to future studies, or as a collectible.
  - Distinguishes between those who only consented and those who completed the study.

### Summary Table

| NFT/Token Type         | When Minted         | Purpose                                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Consent NFT           | On consent/join     | Proof of informed consent, eligibility  |
| Completion NFT/Token  | On study completion | Proof of participation, reward, status  |

This dual-NFT/token approach ensures that RecruSearch meets both ethical requirements for verifiable consent and practical needs for incentivizing and tracking genuine participation, all while preserving participant privacy and data sovereignty.
